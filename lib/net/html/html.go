// Package html extends the golang.org/x/net/html by providing simplified
// methods to Node.
//
// The x/net/html package currently only provide bare raw functionalities
// to iterate tree, there is no check for empty node, and no function to
// get attribute by name without looping it manually.
//
// This package extends the parent package by adding methods to get node's
// attribute by name, get the first non-empty child, get the next
// non-empty sibling, and method to iterate the tree.
