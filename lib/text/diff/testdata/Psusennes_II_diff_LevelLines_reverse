Libyan) subordinate named Wayheset to the desert oasis town of Dakhla in order to restore the king's authority over the western oasis region of Upper Egypt. Wayheset's titles include Prince and Governor of the Oasis. His activities are recorded in the Large Dakhla stela.<ref name=\"Kitchen, p.290\">Kitchen, p.290</ref>  This stela states that Wayheset adjudicated in a certain water dispute by consulting a land-register which is explicitly dated to Year 19 of a \"Pharaoh Psusennes\" in order to determine the water rights of a man named Nysu-Bastet.<ref>[[Alan H. Gardiner]], The Large Dakhla stela, JEA 19 (1930), pp.19-30</ref> Kitchen notes that this individual made an appeal to the Year 19 cadastral land-register of king Psusennes which belonged to his mother which historians assumed was made some \"80 years\" ago during the reign of Psusennes I.<ref name=\"Kitchen, p.290\"/> The land register recorded that certain water rights were formerly owned by Nysu-Bastet's mother Tewhunet in Year 19 of a king Psusennes. This ruler was generally assumed by Egyptologists to be Psusennes I rather than Psusennes II since the latter's reign was believed to have lasted only 14–15 years. Based on the land register evidence, Wayheset ordered that these watering rights should now be granted to Nysu-Bastet himself. However, if the oracle dated to Year 19 of Psusennes I as many scholars traditionally assumed, Nysu-Bastet would have been separated from his mother by a total of 80 years from this date into Year 5 of Shoshenq I—a figure which is highly unlikely since Nysu-Bastet would not have waited until extreme old age to uphold his mother's watering rights. This implies that the aforementioned king Psusennes here must be identified with Psusennes II instead—Shoshenq I's immediate predecessor and, more significantly, that Psusennes II enjoyed a minimum reign of 19 years. \r"

38 - "The term \"mother\" in ancient Egypt could also be an allusion to an ancestress, the matriarch of a lineage whereby Nysu-Bastet may have been petitioning for his hereditary water rights that belonged to his grandmother, whose family name was Tewhunet. However, this argument does not account for the use of Pharaoh as a title in the Dakhla stela—a literary device which first occurs late during the reign of Siamun, an Egyptian king who ruled between 45 to 64 years after Year 19 of Psusennes I.  \r"

40 - "The most significant component of the Great Dakhla stela is its palaeography: the use of the title Pharaoh Psusennes. A scholar named Helen Jacquet-Gordon believed in the 1970s that the large Dakhla stela belonged to [[Shoshenq III]]'s reign due to its use of the title 'Pharaoh' directly with the ruling king's birth name—ie: \"'''Pharaoh Shoshenq'''\"--which was an important palaeographical development in Egyptian history. Throughout the Old, Middle and New Kingdoms of Ancient Egypt, the word pharaoh was never employed as a title such as Mr. and Mrs. or attached to a king's [[Ancient Egyptian royal titulary#Personal name (nomen)|nomen]] such as ''Pharaoh Ramesses'' or ''Pharaoh Amenhotep''; instead, the word '''pr-`3''' or pharaoh was used as a noun to refer to the ''activities'' of the king (i.e., it was \"Pharaoh\" who ordered the creation of a temple or statue, or the digging of a well, etc.).  Rolf Krauss aptly observes that the earliest attested use of the word pharaoh as a title is documented in Year 17 of the 21st Dynasty king [[Siamun]] from Karnak Priestly Annals fragment 3B<ref>J-M Kruchten, Les annales des prētres de Karnak (OLA) 1989. pp.47-48</ref> while a second use of the title ''''[Pharaoh] [birth name]'''' occurs during Psusennes II's reign where a hieratic graffito in the Ptah chapel of the Abydos temple of Seti I explicitly refers to Psusennes II as the \"High Priest of Amen-Re, King of the Gods, the Leader, '''Pharaoh Psusennes'''.\"<ref>M.A. Murray, The Osireion at Abydos (London, 1989), 36; pl.
