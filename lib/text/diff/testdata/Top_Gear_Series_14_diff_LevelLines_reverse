47 - "'''Review''': Clarkson reviews the new V10-engined [[Audi R8#V10 engine|Audi R8]] which produces 518bhp and a top speed of 199mph. He praises the car immensely, calling it \"phenomenal\" and that the handling is \"epic\", saying that it is \"spectacularly good\" whilst being fairly practical also. However, he thinks that the cup holder is wrongly placed, being in a position that one would knock the contents over whilst changing gear, that the trip computer on the car he tested was broken (although it was later revealed that he had not reset it properly) and that the list price of around £100,000 was too expensive as were the optional extras e.g. ceramic brakes are an extra £7,000 and colour coordinated seat belts £750 plus Audi charge an additional £500 if one were to pick it up from the dealership instead of having it delivered. Overall, he said he would not buy the R8 due to it being \"too perfect\" and \"joyless\" stating that it was built purely for speed instead of fun.\r"
