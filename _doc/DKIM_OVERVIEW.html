<p>This document provide note and summary of RFC 5585, DKIM Service Overview.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>DKIM defines a domain-level digital signature authentication framework for
email through the use of private-/public-key (asymmetric) cryptography and
using the Domain Name System (DNS) as its key server technology.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>DKIM uses a domain name as an identifier.
Identifier refer to the identity of a responsible person or organization.
The same identity can have multiple identifiers.
This identifier is called the Signing Domain IDentifier (SDID) and is
contained in the DKIM-Signature header fields "d=" tag.
The owner of the SDID is declaring that they accept responsibility for the
message and can thus be held accountable for it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A DKIM signature:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Does not authenticate or verify the contents of the message header or body,
such as the author "From" field, beyond certifying data integrity between the
time of signing and the time of verifying.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does not offer any assertions about the behaviors of the signer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does not prescribe any specific actions for receivers to take upon
successful signature verification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does not provide protection after signature verification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does not protect against re-sending (replay of) a message that
already has a verified signature; therefore, a transit intermediary or a
recipient can re-post the message &#8212; that is, post it as a new message &#8212; with
the original signature remaining verifiable, even though the new recipient(s)
might be different from those who were originally specified by the
author.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_the_dkim_value_proposition">2. The DKIM Value Proposition</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_identity_verification">2.1. Identity Verification</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An assessment service that uses DKIM can differentiate between a domain (SDID)
used by a known organization and a domain used by others.
As such, DKIM performs the positive step of identifying messages associated
with verifiable identities, rather than the negative step of identifying
messages with problematic use of identities.
Whether a verified identity belongs to a Good Actor or a Bad Actor is a
question for later stages of assessment.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_enabling_trust_assessments">2.2. Enabling Trust Assessments</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A valid DKIM signature neither lowers nor raises the level of trust associated
with the message, but it enables other mechanisms to be used for doing so.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An organization might build upon its use of DKIM by publishing information
about its Signing Practices (SP).
This could permit detecting some messages that purport to be associated with a
domain, but which are not.
As such, an SP can cause the trust assessment to be reduced, or leave it
unchanged.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_establishing_message_validity">2.3. Establishing Message Validity</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An interesting side effect of the cryptographic method used by DKIM is that it
is possible to be certain that a signed message (or, if "l=" is used, the
signed portion of a message) has not been modified between the time of signing
and the time of verifying.
If it has been changed in any way, then the message will not be verified
successfully with DKIM.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_dkim_goals">3. DKIM Goals</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_functional_goals">3.1. Functional Goals</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Use Domain-Level Granularity for Assurance</strong>.
DKIM binds a signing key record to a Domain Name as the SDID.
Further benefits of using domain names include simplifying key management,
enabling signing by the infrastructure as opposed to the MUA, and
reducing privacy concerns.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Implementation Locality</strong>.
Any party, anywhere along the transit path, can implement DKIM signing.
Its use is not confined to particular systems, such as the author&#8217;s MUA or the
inbound boundary MTA, and there can be more than one signature per message.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Allow Delegation of Signing to Independent Parties</strong>.
DKIM was designed to support signing by any of these different parties and to
permit them to sign with any domain name that they deem appropriate (and for
which they hold authorized signing keys).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Distinguish the Core Authentication Mechanism from Its Derivative Uses</strong>.
An authenticated identity can be subject to a variety of assessment policies,
either ad-hoc or standardized.
DKIM separates basic authentication from assessment.
The only semantics inherent to a DKIM signature are that the signer is
asserting some kind of responsibility for the message.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Retain Ability to Have Anonymous Email</strong>.
DKIM is compatible with this goal since it permits authentication of the email
system operator, rather than the content author.
If it is possible to obtain effectively anonymous accounts at example.com,
knowing that a message definitely came from example.com does not threaten
the anonymity of the user who authored it.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_operational_goals">3.2. Operational Goals</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Make Presence of Signature Transparent to Non-Supporting Recipients</strong>.
Recipient that does not support DKIM still can read the message.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Treat Verification Failure the Same as No Signature Present</strong>.
If verification of the message&#8217;s signature failed, the message will revert to
normal handling, through the receiver&#8217;s existing filtering mechanisms.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Permit Incremental Adoption for Incremental Benefit</strong>.
DKIM allows pairwise sets of email providers and spam filtering companies to
distinguish mail that is associated with a known organization, versus mail
that might deceptively purport to have the affiliation.
This in turn allows the development of "whitelist" schemes whereby
authenticated mail from a known source with good reputation is allowed to
bypass some anti-abuse filters.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Minimize the Amount of Required Infrastructure</strong>.
DKIM makes no changes to the core Internet Mail service and its reliance on
the Domain Name System (DNS) greatly reduces the amount of new administrative
infrastructure that is needed across the open Internet.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Permit a Wide Range of Deployment Choices</strong>.
DKIM can be deployed at a variety of places within an organization&#8217;s
email service.
This affords flexibility in terms of who administers its use, as well as what
traffic carries a DKIM signature.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_dkim_function">4. DKIM Function</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_basic_signing">4.1. Basic Signing</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With the DKIM signature mechanism, a signer chooses an SDID, performs digital
signing on the message, and adds the signature information using a DKIM header
field.
A verifier obtains the domain name and the "selector" from the DKIM header
field, obtains the public key associated with the name, and verifies the
signature.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_characteristics_of_a_dkim_signature">4.2. Characteristics of a DKIM Signature</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A DKIM signature applies to the message body and selected header fields.
The signer computes a hash of the selected header fields and another hash of
the body.
The signer then uses a private key to cryptographically encode this
information, along with other signing parameters.
Signature information is placed into "DKIM-Signature:", a new [RFC5322]
message header field.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_selector_construct">4.3. The Selector Construct</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A single SDID can have multiple signing keys and/or multiple potential
signers.
To support this, DKIM identifies a particular signature as using a combination
of the SDID and an added field, called the "selector", specified in a separate
"DKIM-Signature:" header field parameter.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_verification">4.4. Verification</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Message recipients can verify the signature by querying the DNS for the
signer&#8217;s domain directly, to retrieve the appropriate public key, and thereby
confirm that the message was signed by a party in possession of the private
key for the SDID.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Typically, verification will be done by an agent in the Administrative
Management Domain (ADMD) of the message recipient.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_sub_domain_assessment">4.5. Sub-Domain Assessment</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To permit assessments that are independent, one method is for an organization
to use different sub-domains as the SDID tag.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_service_architecture">5. Service Architecture</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>DKIM uses external service components, such as for key retrieval and relaying
email.
This specification defines an initial set, using DNS and SMTP, for basic
interoperability.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Signing</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Signing can be performed by a component of the ADMD that creates the message,
and/or within any ADMD along the relay path.
The signer uses the appropriate private key that is associated with the SDID.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Verifying</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Verifying is performed by an authorized module within the verifying ADMD.
Within a delivering ADMD, verifying might be performed by an MTA, MDA, or MUA.
The module verifies the signature or determines whether a particular signature
was required.
Verifying the signature uses public information from the Key Store.
If the signature passes, reputation information is used to assess the signer
and that information is passed to the message filtering system.
If the signature fails or there is no signature using the author&#8217;s domain,
information about signing practices related to the author can be retrieved
remotely and/or locally, and that information is passed to the message
filtering system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Messages lacking a valid author signature can prompt a query for any
published "signing practices" information, as an aid in determining whether
the author information has been used without authorization.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Assessing</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A popular use of reputation information is as input to a Filtering Engine that
decides whether to deliver &#8212; and possibly whether to specially mark &#8212; a
message.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Their details are outside of the scope of DKIM, other than the expectation
that the verified identity produced by DKIM can accumulate its own reputation,
and will be added to the varied soup of rules used by the engines.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Key Store</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>DKIM uses public-/private-key (asymmetric) cryptography.
The signer uses a private key and the verifier uses the corresponding public
key.
The current DKIM Signing specification provides for querying the Domain Names
Service (DNS), to permit a verifier to obtain the public key.
The signing organization therefore needs to have a means of adding a key to
the DNS, for every selector/SDID combination.
Further, the signing organization needs policies for distributing and revising
keys.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Reputation/Accreditation</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a message contains a valid signature, then the verifier can evaluate the
associated domain name&#8217;s reputation, in order to determine appropriate
delivery or display options for that message.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Signing Practices (SP)</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Separate from determining the validity of a signature, and separate from
assessing the reputation of the organization that is associated with the
signed identity, there is an opportunity to determine any organizational
practices concerning a domain name.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The statements of practice are made at the level of a domain name, and are
distinct from assessments made about particular messages, as occur in a
Message Filtering Engine.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As practices are defined, each domain name owner needs to consider what
information to publish.
The nature and degree of checking practices, if any are performed, is optional
to the evaluating site and is strictly a matter of local policy.</p>
