<h3 id="_choosing_a_dkim_tag_for_the_assessment_identifier">Choosing a DKIM Tag for the Assessment Identifier</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>DKIM has three values that specify identification information and it is easy
to confuse their use, although only one defines the formal input and output of
DKIM, with the other two being used for internal protocol functioning and
adjunct purposes, such as auditing and debugging.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>DKIM&#8217;s primary task is to communicate from the Signer to a recipient-side
Identity Assessor a single Signing Domain Identifier (SDID) that refers to a
responsible identity.
DKIM MAY optionally provide a single responsible Agent or User Identifier
(AUID).
A receive-side DKIM verifier MUST communicate the Signing Domain Identifier
(d=) to a consuming Identity Assessor module and MAY communicate the User
Agent Identifier (i=) if present.
To the extent that a receiver attempts to intuit any structured semantics for
either of the identifiers, this is a heuristic function that is outside the
scope of DKIM&#8217;s specification and semantics.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The single, mandatory value that DKIM supplies as its output is:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>d=</strong>
This tag specify domain name of signing identity, also called Signing Domain
Identifier (SDID).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The adjunct values are:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>s=</strong>
This tag specifies the selector, to discriminate among different keys that can
be used for the same SDID.
As discussed in Section 4.3 of [RFC5585],</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"If verifiers were to employ the selector as part of an assessment mechanism,
then there would be no remaining mechanism for making a transition from an
old, or compromised, key to a new one".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Consequently, the selector is not appropriate for use as part or all of the
identifier used to make assessments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>i=</strong>
This tag is optional and provides the Agent or User Identifier (AUID)
on behalf of which the SDID is taking responsibility [RFC5672].
The identity can be in the syntax of an entire email address or only a domain
name.
The domain name can be the same as for "d=" or it can be a sub-name of the
"d=" name.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock note">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<div class="title">Note</div>
</td>
<td class="content">
Although the "i=" identity has the syntax of an email address, it is not
required to have those semantics.
That is, "the identity of the user" need not be the same as the user&#8217;s
mailbox.
For example, the signer might wish to use "i=" to encode user-related audit
information, such as how they were accessing the service at the time of
message posting.
Therefore, it is not possible to conclude anything from the "i=" string&#8217;s
(dis)similarity to email addresses elsewhere in the header.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, "i=" can have any of these properties:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Be a valid domain when it is the same as "d="</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appear to be a subdomain of "d=" but might not even exist</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Look like a mailbox address but might have different semantics and
therefore not function as a valid email address</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be unique for each message, such as indicating access details of the user
for the specific posting</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This underscores why the tag needs to be treated as being opaque, since it can
represent any semantics, known only to the signer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hence, "i=" serves well as a token that is usable like a Web cookie, for
return to the signing Administrative Management Domain (ADMD) -- such as for
auditing and debugging.
Of course in some scenarios the "i=" string might provide a useful adjunct
value for additional (heuristic) processing by the Handling Filter.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_choosing_the_signing_domain_name">Choosing the Signing Domain Name</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For an entity creating DKIM signatures, it is likely that different portions
of its mail will warrant different levels of trust.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is therefore likely to be useful for a signer to use different "d="
subdomain names, for different message traffic streams, so that receivers can
make differential assessments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Generally, in a trust system, legitimate signers have an incentive to pick a
small stable set of identities, so that recipients and others can attribute
reputations to them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hence, the challenge is to determine a useful scheme for labeling different
traffic streams.
The most obvious choices are among different types of content and/or different
types of authors.
Although stability is essential, it is likely that the choices will change,
over time, so the scheme needs to be flexible.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_recipient_based_assessments">Recipient-Based Assessments</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With DKIM, the Assessor can know that two messages with the same SDID are, in
fact, signed by the same person or organization.
This permits a far more stable and accurate assessment of mail traffic.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With the identifier(s) supplied by DKIM, the Assessor can consult an
independent assessment service about the entity associated with the
identifier(s).
Another possibility is that the Assessor can develop its own reputation rating
for the identifier(s).</p>

<p>Best practices on key managements,</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The signing key itself needs to be under direct control of as few key
holders as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a key holder were to leave the organization, all signing keys held by
that key holder need to be withdrawn from service and, if appropriate,
replaced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If key management hardware support is available, it needs to be used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If keys are stored in software, appropriate file control protections
need to be employed, and any location in which the private key is stored in
plaintext form needs to be excluded from regular backup processes and is best
not accessible through any form of network including private local area
networks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A signature key needs to exist in exactly one location and be erased when
no longer used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ideally, a signature key pair needs to be generated as close to the signing
point as possible, and only the public key component transferred to another
party.
If this is not possible, the private key needs to be transported in an
encrypted format that protects the confidentiality of the signing key.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Key escrow schemes (managed by third party) are not necessary and are best
not used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An operational practice in which the private key is stored in tamper-proof
hardware and changed once a year is considerably more desirable than one in
which the signature key is changed on an hourly basis but maintained in
software.</p>

<h3 id="_third_party_signature">Third Party Signature</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A signature whose domain does not match the domain of the RFC5322.From address
is sometimes referred to as a third-party signature.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Third-party signatures encompass a wide range of identities.
Some of the more common are:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Service Provider</strong>:
An organization may outsourced their email to other provider.
Such provider can DKIM-sign outbound mail with their own identifier.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Parent Domain</strong>:
As discussed above, organizations choosing to apply a parent-domain signature
to mail originating from subdomains can have their signatures treated as third
party by some verifiers, depending on whether or not the "t=s" tag is used to
constrain the parent signature to apply only to its own specific domain.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Reputation Provider</strong>:
Such a signature would indicate to receivers that the message was being
vouched for by that third party.</p>

</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_using_trusted_third_party_ttp_senders">Using Trusted Third Party (TTP) Senders</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A different model arises when an organization uses a trusted third-party
sender for certain key business functions, but still wants that email to
benefit from the organization&#8217;s own identity and reputation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This can be done by having the third party generate a key pair that is
designated uniquely for use by that trusted third party and publishing the
public key in the controlling organization&#8217;s DNS domain, thus enabling the
third party to sign mail using the signature of the controlling organization.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_dns_delegation">DNS Delegation</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this case, Company A would create a subdomain benefits.companya.example,
and delegate the DNS management of that subdomain to the benefits company
so it could maintain its own key records.
When revocation becomes necessary, Company A could simply remove the DNS
delegation record.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_multiple_signatures">Multiple Signatures</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One important caveat to the use of multiple signatures is that there is
currently no clear consensus among receivers on how they plan to handle them.
The opinions range from ignoring all but one signature (and the specification
of which of them is verified differs from receiver to receiver), to verifying
all signatures present and applying a weighted blend of the trust assessments
for those identifiers, to verifying all signatures present and simply using
the identifier that represents the most positive trust assessment.
It is likely that the industry will evolve to accept multiple signatures using
either the second or third of these, but it can take some time before one
approach becomes pervasive.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are a number of situations where applying more than one DKIM signature
to the same message might make sense.
A few examples are:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Companies with multiple subdomain identities.
A company that has multiple subdomains sending distinct categories of mail
might choose to sign with distinct subdomain identities to enable each
subdomain to manage its own identity.
However, it might also want to provide a common identity that cuts across all of the distinct subdomains.
For example, Company A can sign mail for its sales department with a signature
where "d=sales.companya.example" and a second signature where
"d=companya.example".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Service Providers.
A service provider can, as described above, choose to sign outbound messages
with either its own identity or an identity unique to each of its clients
(possibly delegated).
However, it can also do both: sign each outbound message with its own identity
as well as with the identity of each individual client.
For example, ESP A might sign mail for its client Company B with its service
provider signature "d=espa.example", and a second client-specific signature
where "d=" either "companyb.example" or "companyb.espa.example".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forwarders.
Some forwarders such as mailing lists or "forward article to a friend"
services might choose to add their own signatures to outbound messages to
vouch for them having legitimately originated from the designated service.
In this case, the signature would be added even in the presence of a
preexisting signature, and both signatures would be relevant to the verifier.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Any forwarder that modifies messages in ways that will break preexisting DKIM
signatures needs to sign its forwarded messages.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Reputation Providers.
It is possible that they, or other organizations willing to put their "seal of
approval" on an email stream, might choose to use a DKIM signature to do it.
In nearly all cases, this "reputation" signature would be in addition to the
author or originator signature.</p>

</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_some_adsp_examples">Some ADSP Examples</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An organization (Company A) can specify its signing practices by
publishing an ADSP record with "dkim=all" or "dkim=discardable".
Any email with an RFC5322.From address that uses the domain where the ADSP
record is published that does not have a valid author signature is at risk of
being misdelivered or discarded.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, email with an RFC5322.From address of "bob@companyA.example"
needs to have an author signature where the SDID value is "companyA.example"
or it will fail an ADSP validation.
If a message with an RFC5322.From address of "newsletter@companyA.example" has
a signature with "d=marketing.companyA.example", that message will fail the
ADSP check because the signature would not be considered a valid author
signature.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In particular, in order to prevent mail from being negatively impacted or even

outbound mail from a domain before publishing an ADSP policy of anything

<h3 id="_a_non_standard_submission_and_delivery_scenarios">A Non-Standard Submission and Delivery Scenarios</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The robustness of DKIM&#8217;s verification mechanism is based on the fact
that only authorized signing modules have access to the designated
private key.
This has the side effect that email submission and delivery scenarios that
originate or relay messages from outside the domain of the authorized signing
module will not have access to that protected private key, and thus will be
unable to attach the expected domain signature to those messages.
Such scenarios include mailing lists, courtesy forwarders, MTAs at hotels,
hotspot networks used by traveling users, and other paths that could add
or modify headers, or modify the message body.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, assume that Joe have email address at joe@company-a.example,
joe@isp-1.example, and joe@isp-2.example.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When Joe send email through "isp-1" as "joe@company-a.example", that email
cannot have a signature with d=company-a.example, because "isp-1"
have no access to company-a.example&#8217;s private key.
The email will have signature from "isp-1.example" instead.</p>

<h3 id="_signature_granularity">Signature Granularity</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is possible to administer subdomains or otherwise adjust signatures in a

the signing identity and specifying an extension to the "i=" value that has a
per-user granularity or by creating and signing with unique per-user keys.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In most cases, it would be impractical to sign email on a per-user
granularity.
Such an approach would be</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>likely to be ignored:</strong>
In most cases today, if receivers are verifying DKIM signatures, they are in
general taking the simplest possible approach.
In many cases, maintaining reputation information at a per-user granularity is
not interesting to them, in large part because the per-user volume is too
small to be useful or interesting.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>difficult to manage:</strong>
Any scheme that involves maintenance of a significant number of public keys
might require infrastructure enhancements or extensive administrative
expertise.
This can create significant and often unnecessary management complexity.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>For those who choose to represent user-level granularity in signatures, the

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If MUAs add their own signature, and MSA needs to perform operation on a
message to make it comply with its email sending policy, it needs to do so in
a way that would not break those signatures.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>MUA are generally not under direct control of organization and more vulnerable
to attack and compromise, which would jeopardize the integrity and reputation
of the organization.
So, MUA ability to sign is not encouraged.</p>

<p><strong>Inbound</strong></p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>When an organization deploys DKIM, it needs to make sure that its email
infrastructure components that do not have primary roles in DKIM handling do
not modify message in ways that prevent subsequent verification.</p>

<p><strong>Intermediaries</strong>
An email intermediary is both an inbound and outbound MTA.
If the intermediary modifies a message in a way that breaks the signature, the
intermediary,</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>needs to deploy abuse filtering measures on the inbound mail, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>probably also needs to remove all signatures that will be broken.</p>

<p>The intermediary can,</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>

<p>verify the message signature prior to modification.</p>

<li>
<p>incorporate an indication of the verification results into the message,
such as using an Authentication-Results header field [RFC5451].</p>

<li>
<p>sign the modified message including the verification results (e.g., the
Authentication-Results header field).</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>An MUA can sign a message, even if its not encouraged.
In this case the signature from MUA is an addition to signature added by MSA.
If user  software act as MSA and employed for sending directly to a receiving
ADMD, the user software need to be considere an outbound MTA.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Inbound</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An MUA can rely on report of DKIM verification from inbound MTA/MDA, or they
can perform verification directly.
If verification fails, the message is to be treated the same as a message that
does not have a signature.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>An MUA that looks for an Authentication-Results header field needs to be
configurable to choose which Authentication-Results header fields are
considered trustable.
The MUA developer is encouraged to re-read the Security Considerations of
[RFC5451].</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Verified DKIM signature cannot be used by an MUA to indicate that a message is
to be treated better than a message without a verified DKIM signature.
However, it can be used as input into a reputation system.</p>
