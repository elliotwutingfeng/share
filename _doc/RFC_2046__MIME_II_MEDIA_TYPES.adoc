This document provide note and summary of
{url-rfc2046}[RFC 2046^],
Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part Two: Media Types.

==  Introduction

There are two groups media type: discrete and composite.
Discrete media type are "text", "image", "audio", "video", and "application".
Composite media type are "multipart" and "message".


==  Text Media Type

*  Canonical form of any MIME "text" subtype MUST always represent a
   line break as a CRLF sequence.
   Use of CR and LF outside of line break sequences is forbidden.

*  Unrecognized subtypes of "text" should be treated as subtype "plain"
   as long as the MIME implementation knows how to handle the charset.

*  Unrecognized subtypes which also specify an unrecognized charset
   should be treated as "application/octet-stream".


===  Plain Subtype

*  Subtype "plain" is seen simply as a linear sequence of characters, possibly
   interrupted by line breaks or page breaks.

*  A "charset" parameter may be used to indicate the character set of the body

**  Default charset is US-ASCII.

**  The values of the charset parameter are NOT case sensitive.

**  It is strongly recommended that new user agents explicitly specify a
    character set as a media type parameter in the Content-Type header field.


== Image Media Type

*  A media type of "image" indicates that the body contains an image.

*  The subtype names the specific image format, defined in RFC 2048.

*  Unrecognized subtypes of "image" should at a minimum be treated as
   "application/octet-stream".


==  Audio Media Type

*  A media type of "audio" indicates that the body contains audio data.

*  Unrecognized subtypes of "audio" should at a miniumum be treated as
   "application/octet-stream".


==  Video Media Type

*  A media type of "video" indicates that the body contains a
   time-varying-picture image, possibly with color and coordinated sound.

*  The subtype "mpeg" refers to video coded according to the MPEG standard
   [MPEG].

*  Unrecognized subtypes of "video" should at a minumum be treated as
   "application/octet-stream".


==  Application Media Type

*  The "application" media type is to be used for discrete data which do
   not fit in any of the other categories, and particularly for data to
   be processed by some type of application program.


===  Octet-Stream Subtype

The "octet-stream" subtype is used to indicate that a body contains arbitrary
binary data.
This subtype define the following optional parameters:

.  TYPE -- the general type or category of binary data.
   This is intended as information for the human recipient rather than for
   any automatic processing.

.  PADDING -- the number of bits of padding that were appended to the
   bit-stream comprising the actual contents to produce the enclosed 8bit
   byte-oriented data.
   This is useful for enclosing a bit-stream in a body when the total number
   of bits is not a multiple of 8.


===  Postscript Subtype

A media type of "application/postscript" indicates a PostScript program.

*  The execution of general-purpose PostScript interpreters entails
   serious security risks, and implementors are discouraged from simply
   sending PostScript bodies to "off-the-shelf" interpreters.


== Multipart Media Type

....
multipart-body    := [preamble CRLF]
                     dash-boundary transport-padding CRLF
                     body-part *encapsulation
                     close-delimiter transport-padding
                     [CRLF epilogue]

dash-boundary     := "--" boundary

transport-padding := *LWSP-char
                   ; Composers MUST NOT generate non-zero length transport
                   ; padding, but receivers MUST be able to handle padding
                   ; added by message transports.

encapsulation     := delimiter transport-padding CRLF
                     body-part

delimiter         := CRLF dash-boundary

close-delimiter   := delimiter "--"

preamble          := discard-text

epilogue          := discard-text

discard-text      := *(*text CRLF) *text
                   ; May be ignored or discarded.

body-part         := MIME-part-headers [CRLF *OCTET]
                   ; Lines in a body-part must not start with the specified
		   ; dash-boundary and the delimiter must not appear anywhere
                   ; in the body part.  Note that the ; semantics of a
		   ; body-part differ from the semantics of a message, as
                   ; described in the text.

OCTET             := <any 0-255 octet value>
....

*  A "multipart" media type field MUST appear in the entity's header.

*  The body MUST then contain one or more body parts, each preceded by a
   boundary delimiter line, and the last one followed by a closing boundary
   delimiter line.

**  After its boundary delimiter line, each body part then consists of a
    header area, a blank line, and a body area.

**  The boundary delimiter MUST NOT appear inside any of the encapsulated
    parts, on a line by itself or as the prefix of any line.

*  A body part is an entity and hence is NOT to be interpreted as actually
   being an RFC 822 message.

*  NO header fields are actually required in body parts.

*  The only header fields that have defined meaning for body parts are
   those the names of which begin with "Content-".
   All other header fields may be ignored in body parts.

*  All present and future subtypes of the "multipart" type MUST use an
   identical syntax.


===  Common Syntax

....
boundary      := 0*69<bchars> bcharsnospace

bchars        := bcharsnospace / " "

bcharsnospace := DIGIT / ALPHA / "'" / "(" / ")" /
                 "+" / "_" / "," / "-" / "." /
                 "/" / ":" / "=" / "?"
....

*  The Content-Type field for multipart entities requires one parameter,
   "boundary".

*  The boundary delimiter line is then defined as a line consisting entirely
   of two hyphen characters ("-", decimal value 45) followed by the boundary
   parameter value, optional linear whitespace, and a terminating CRLF.

*  The boundary delimiter MUST occur at the beginning of a line

*  The boundary may be followed by zero or more characters of linear
   whitespace

*  The CRLF preceding the boundary delimiter line is conceptually
   attached to the boundary so that it is possible to have a part that
   does not end with a CRLF

*  Boundary MUST be no longer than 70 characters, not counting the two
   leading hyphens.

*  Boundary with two hyphen at the end indicated the end of message body.


===  Mixed Subtype

*  The "mixed" subtype of "multipart" is intended for use when the body
   parts are independent and need to be bundled in a particular order.

*  Any "multipart" subtypes that an implementation does not recognize
   MUST be treated as being of subtype "mixed".


===  Alternative Subtype

In "multipart/alternative", each of the body parts is an "alternative" version
of the same information.

*  The order of body parts is significant.

*  The best choice is the LAST part of a type supported by the recipient
   system's local environment.

*  User agents that compose "multipart/alternative" entities MUST place the
   body parts in increasing order of preference, that is, with the preferred
   format last.


===  Digest Subtype

The "multipart/digest" Content-Type is intended to be used to send collections of messages.

*  In a digest, the default Content-Type value for a body part is changed from
   "text/plain" to "message/rfc822".

*  If a "text/plain" part is needed, it should be included as a seperate
   part of a "multipart/mixed" message.


===  Parallel Subtype

in a parallel entity, the order of body parts is not significant.


==  Message Media Type

It is frequently desirable, in sending mail, to encapsulate another mail
message.
A special media type, "message", is defined to encapsulate another mail
message.
The "rfc822" subtype of "message" is used to encapsulate RFC 822 messages.


===  RFC822 Subtype

*  "message/rfc822" body must include a "From", "Date", and at least one
   destination header is removed and replaced with the requirement that
   at least one of "From", "Subject", or "Date" must be present.

*  "message/rfc822" entity isn't restricted to material in strict
   conformance to RFC822, it could well be a News article or a MIME message.

*  No encoding other than "7bit", "8bit", or "binary" is permitted for the
   body of a "message/rfc822" entity.

*  The message header fields are always US-ASCII in any cases.


===  Partial Subtype

The "partial" subtype is defined to allow large entities to be delivered as
several separate pieces of mail and automatically reassembled by a receiving
user agent.

*  Entities of type "message/partial" must always have a
   content-transfer-encoding of 7bit (the default).

*  The use of a content-transfer-encoding of "8bit" or "binary" is explicitly
   prohibited.

*  When generating and reassembling the pieces of a "message/partial"
   message, the headers of the encapsulated message must be merged with
   the headers of the enclosing entities

**  The result is always a complete MIME entity, which may have its own
    Content-Type header field, and thus may contain any other data type.

Three parameters must be specified, in no particular order,

.  *"id"*, is a unique identifier, as close to a world-unique identifier as
   possible, to be used to match the fragments together.
   In general, the identifier is essentially a message-id.

.  *"number"*, an integer, is the fragment number, which indicates where this
   fragment fits into the sequence of fragments.

*  Fragment numbering begins with 1, not 0.

.  *"total"*, another integer, is the total number of fragments.

When generating and reassembling the fragments, the following rules MUST be
observed:

.  Fragmentation agents must split messages at line boundaries only.

.  All of the header fields from the initial enclosing message, except those
   that start with "Content-" and the specific header fields "Subject",
   "Message-ID", "Encrypted", and "MIME-Version", must be copied, in order,
   to the new message.

.  All of the header fields from the second and any subsequent enclosing
   messages are discarded by the reassembly process.


===  External-Body Subtype

The external-body subtype indicates that the actual body data are not
included, but merely referenced.
In this case, the parameters describe a mechanism for accessing the external
data.

*  "message/external-body" consists of a header, two consecutive CRLFs, and
   the message header for the encapsulated message.

*  If another pair of consecutive CRLFs appears, this of course ends the
   message header for the encapsulated message.

*  Any text after encapsulated message header, also called "phantom body", is
   ignored.

**  The only access-type defined in this document that uses the phantom body
    is "mail-server"

*  The encapsulated headers in ALL "message/external-body" entities MUST
   include a Content-ID header field to give a unique identifier by
   which to reference the data.

**  This identifier may be used for caching mechanisms, and for recognizing
    the receipt of the data when the access-type is "mail-server".

*  The tokens that describe external-body data, such as file names and mail
   server commands, are required to be in the US-ASCII character set.

*  MIME entities of type "message/external-body" MUST have a
   content-transfer-encoding of 7bit (the default).

The parameters that may be used with any "message/external-body" are:

.  ACCESS-TYPE -- A word indicating the supported access mechanism by which
   the file or data may be obtained.
   This word is not case sensitive.

..  Values include, but are not limited to, "FTP", "ANON-FTP", "TFTP",
    "LOCAL-FILE", and "MAIL-SERVER".

..  This parameter is unconditionally mandatory and MUST be present.

.  EXPIRATION -- The date after which the existence of the external data is
   not guaranteed.

..   This parameter may be used with ANY access-type and is ALWAYS optional.

.  SIZE -- The size (in octets) of the data in its canonical form, that is,
   before any Content-Transfer-Encoding has been applied or after the data
   have been decoded.

..  This parameter may be used with ANY access-type and is ALWAYS optional.
