# shuLhan/share internal documentation
Shulhan <ms@kilabit.info>

Beside
https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/shuLhan/share#section-documentation[the Go documentation],
that provides documentation for API in the `share` module, there are also
additional documentations that we can not include inside source code due to
their scope and limitation of Go doc formatting itself.
