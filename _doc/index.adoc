Beside
https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/shuLhan/share#section-documentation[the Go documentation],
that provides documentation for API in the `share` module, there are also
additional documentations that we can not include inside source code due to
their scope and limitation of Go doc formatting itself.

NOTE: The links below is used to be viewed locally, not through Github or
pkg.go.dev.

The documentation is created and generated using
https://git.sr.ht/~shulhan/ciigo[`ciigo`].

To serve documentation on HTTP server at http://127.0.0.1:21019 and watch
changes on documentation files (".adoc") and regenerate the HTML
files, run

----
$ make docs-serve
