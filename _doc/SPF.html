<p>This document provide note and summary of
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7208">RFC 7208</a>,
Sender Policy Framework (SPF) for Authorizing Use of Domains in Email, Version
1.
The content of this document are merged with errata that are reported before
2019-04-04.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_introduction">Introduction</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This document defines a protocol by which ADministrative Management Domains
(ADMD) can authorize hosts to use their domain names in the &#34;MAIL FROM&#34; or
&#34;HELO&#34; identities.
Compliant ADMDs publish Sender Policy Framework (SPF) records in the DNS
specifying which hosts are permitted to use their names, and compliant mail
receivers use the published SPF records to test the authorization of sending
Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs) using a given &#34;HELO&#34; or &#34;MAIL FROM&#34; identity
during a mail transaction.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_operational_overview">Operational Overview</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_publishing_authorization">Publishing Authorization</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An SPF-compliant domain publishes valid SPF records to authorize the use of
the relevant domain names in the &#34;HELO&#34; and &#34;MAIL FROM&#34; identities by the MTAs
specified therein.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>SPF results can be used to make both positive (source is authorized)
and negative (source is not authorized) determinations.
If ADMDs choose to publish SPF records and want to support receivers making
negative authorization determinations, it is necessary for them to publish
records that end in &#34;-all&#34;, or redirect to other records that do;
otherwise, no definitive determination of authorization can be made.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When changing SPF records, care has to be taken to ensure that there is a
transition period so that the old policy remains valid until all legitimate
email can reasonably expect to have been checked.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_checking_authorization">Checking Authorization</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A mail receiver can perform a set of SPF checks for each mail message it
receives.
Typically, such checks are done by a receiving MTA, but can be performed
elsewhere in the mail processing chain so long as the required information is
available and reliable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Without explicit approval of the publishing ADMD, checking other identities
against SPF version 1 records is NOT RECOMMENDED because there are cases that
are known to give incorrect results.
For example, almost all mailing lists rewrite the &#34;MAIL FROM&#34; identity, but
some do not change any other identities in the message.
Documents that define other identities will have to define the method for
explicit approval.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To make the test, the mail receiver MUST evaluate the check_host() function.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although invalid, malformed, or non-existent domains cause SPF checks to
return &#34;none&#34; because no SPF record can be found, it has long been the policy
of many MTAs to reject email from such domains, especially in the case of
invalid &#34;MAIL FROM&#34;.
Rejecting email will prevent one method of circumventing of SPF records.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Implementations have to take care to correctly extract the &lt;domain&gt; from the
data given with the SMTP MAIL FROM command as many MTAs will still accept such
things as source routes, the %-hack (see [RFC1123]), and bang paths (see
[RFC1983]).
These archaic features have been maliciously used to bypass security systems.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_helo_identity">The &#34;HELO&#34; Identity</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is RECOMMENDED that SPF verifiers not only check the &#34;MAIL FROM&#34; identity
but also separately check the &#34;HELO&#34; identity by applying the check_host()
function (Section 4) to the &#34;HELO&#34; identity as the &lt;sender&gt;.
If a conclusive determination about the message can be made based on a check
of &#34;HELO&#34;, then the use of DNS resources to process the typically more complex
&#34;MAIL FROM&#34; can be avoided.
Additionally, since SPF records published for &#34;HELO&#34; identities refer to a
single host, when available, they are a very reliable source of host
authorization status.
Checking &#34;HELO&#34; before &#34;MAIL FROM&#34; is the RECOMMENDED sequence if both are
checked.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This SPF check can only be performed when the &#34;HELO&#34; string is a valid,
multi-label domain name.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_mail_from_identity">The &#34;MAIL FROM&#34; Identity</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>SPF verifiers MUST check the &#34;MAIL FROM&#34; identity if a &#34;HELO&#34; check either has
not been performed or has not reached a definitive policy result by applying
the check_host() function to the &#34;MAIL FROM&#34; identity as the &lt;sender&gt;.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the reverse-path is null, this document defines the &#34;MAIL FROM&#34; identity to
be the mailbox composed of the local-part &#34;postmaster&#34; and the &#34;HELO&#34; identity
(which might or might not have been checked separately before).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_location_of_checks">Location of Checks</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The authorization check is performed during the SMTP transaction at the time
of the MAIL command, and uses the MAIL FROM value and the client IP address.
Performing the check at later times or with other input can cause problems
such as the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>It might be difficult to accurately extract the required information from
   potentially deceptive headers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Legitimate email might fail the authorization check because the sender&#39;s
   policy has since changed.</p>
</li>
</ul>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_spf_records">SPF Records</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The SPF record is expressed as a single string of text found in the RDATA of a
single DNS TXT resource record; multiple SPF records are not permitted for the
same owner name.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_dns_resource_record">DNS Resource Record</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>SPF records MUST be published as a DNS TXT (type 16) Resource Record (RR)
only.
The character content of the record is encoded as [US-ASCII].</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_multiple_dns_records">Multiple DNS Records</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A domain name MUST NOT have multiple records that would cause an authorization
check to select more than one record.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_multiple_strings_in_a_single_dns_record">Multiple Strings in a Single DNS Record</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a published record contains multiple character-strings, then the record
MUST be treated as if those strings are concatenated together without adding
spaces.
For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>IN TXT &#34;v=spf1 .... first&#34; &#34;second string...&#34;</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>is equivalent to:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>IN TXT &#34;v=spf1 .... firstsecond string...&#34;</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_record_size">Record Size</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the size of the DNS message, the combined length of the DNS name and the
text of all the records of a given type is under 450 octets, then DNS answers
ought to fit in UDP packets.
Records that are too long to fit in a single UDP packet could be silently
ignored by SPF verifiers due to firewall and other issues that interfere with
the operation of DNS over TCP or using EDNS0.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that when computing the sizes for replies to queries of the TXT format,
one has to take into account any other TXT records published at the domain
name.
Similarly, the sizes for replies to all queries related to SPF have to be
evaluated to fit in a single 512-octet UDP packet.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_wildcard_records">Wildcard Records</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Use of wildcard records for publishing is discouraged, and care has to be
taken if they are used.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>SPF records have to be listed twice for every name within the zone:
once for the name, and once with a wildcard to cover the tree under the name,
in order to cover all domains in use in outgoing mail.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_the_check_host_function">The check_host() Function</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>check_host()</code> function fetches SPF records, parses them, and
evaluates them to determine whether a particular host is or is not
permitted to send mail with a given identity.
Receiving ADMDs that perform this check MUST correctly evaluate the
<code>check_host()</code> function as described here.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_arguments">Arguments</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>check_host()</code> function takes these arguments:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>&lt;ip&gt;</code>: the IP address of the SMTP client that is emitting the mail, either
   IPv4 or IPv6.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>&lt;domain&gt;</code>: the domain that provides the sought-after authorization
   information; initially, the domain portion of the &#34;MAIL FROM&#34; or &#34;HELO&#34;
   identity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>&lt;sender&gt;</code>: the &#34;MAIL FROM&#34; or &#34;HELO&#34; identity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<li>
<p>&#34;neutral&#34;: means the ADMD has explicitly stated that it is not asserting
   whether the IP address is authorized.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&#34;pass&#34;: an explicit statement that the client is authorized to inject mail
   with the given identity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&#34;fail&#34;: an explicit statement that the client is not authorized to use the
   domain in the given identity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&#34;softfail&#34;: a weak statement by the publishing ADMD that the host is
   probably not authorized.
   It has not published a stronger, more definitive policy that results in a
   &#34;fail&#34;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&#34;temperror&#34;:  the SPF verifier encountered a transient (generally DNS)
   error while performing the check.
   A later retry may succeed without further DNS operator action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&#34;permerror&#34;:  the domain&#39;s published records could not be correctly

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each mechanism is considered in turn from left to right.
If there are no more mechanisms, the result is the default result.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a mechanism is evaluated, one of three things can happen: it can match,
not match, or return an exception.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If it matches, processing ends and the qualifier value is returned as the
result of that record.
If it does not match, processing continues with the next mechanism.
If it returns an exception, mechanism processing ends and the exception value
is returned.</p>

<p>When a mechanism matches and the qualifier is &#34;-&#34;, then a &#34;fail&#34; result is
returned.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_modifiers">Modifiers</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Modifiers are not mechanisms.
They do not return match or not-match.
Instead, they provide additional information.
Although modifiers do not directly affect the evaluation of the record, the
&#34;redirect&#34; modifier has an effect after all the mechanisms have been
evaluated.</p>

<p>The following terms cause DNS queries: the &#34;include&#34;, &#34;a&#34;, &#34;mx&#34;, &#34;ptr&#34;, and
&#34;exists&#34; mechanisms, and the &#34;redirect&#34; modifier.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>SPF implementations MUST limit the total number of those terms to 10 during
SPF evaluation, to avoid unreasonable load on the DNS.
If this limit is exceeded, the implementation MUST return &#34;permerror&#34;.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The other terms -- the &#34;all&#34;, &#34;ip4&#34;, and &#34;ip6&#34; mechanisms, and the &#34;exp&#34;
modifier -- do not cause DNS queries at the time of SPF evaluation (the
&#34;exp&#34; modifier only causes a lookup at a later time), and their use is not
subject to this limit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When evaluating the &#34;mx&#34; mechanism, the number of &#34;MX&#34; resource records
queried is included in the overall limit of 10 mechanisms/modifiers that
cause DNS lookups as described above.
In addition to that limit, the evaluation of each &#34;MX&#34; record MUST NOT result
in querying more than 10 address records -- either &#34;A&#34; or &#34;AAAA&#34; resource
records.
If this limit is exceeded, the &#34;mx&#34; mechanism MUST produce a &#34;permerror&#34;
result.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When evaluating the &#34;ptr&#34; mechanism or the %{p} macro, the number of &#34;PTR&#34;
resource records queried is included in the overall limit of 10
mechanisms/modifiers that cause DNS lookups as described above.
In addition to that limit, the evaluation of each &#34;PTR&#34; record MUST NOT result
in querying more than 10 address records -- either &#34;A&#34; or &#34;AAAA&#34; resource
records.
If this limit is exceeded, all records other than the first 10 MUST be
ignored.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>check_host()</code> elapsed time SHOULD have limited to least 20 seconds.
If such a limit is exceeded, the result of authorization SHOULD be
&#34;temperror&#34;.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There may be cases where it is useful to limit the number of &#34;terms&#34; for which
DNS queries return either a positive answer (RCODE 0) with an answer count of
0, or a &#34;Name Error&#34; (RCODE 3) answer.
These are sometimes collectively referred to as &#34;void lookups&#34;.
SPF implementations SHOULD limit &#34;void lookups&#34; to two.
An implementation MAY choose to make such a limit configurable.
In this case, a default of two is RECOMMENDED.
Exceeding the limit produces a &#34;permerror&#34; result.</p>

<h3 id="_default_result">Default Result</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If none of the mechanisms match and there is no &#34;redirect&#34; modifier, then the

as the last directive.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If there is a &#34;redirect&#34; modifier, check_host() proceeds as defined in Section
6.1.</p>

<p>It is better to use either a &#34;redirect&#34; modifier or an &#34;all&#34; mechanism to
explicitly terminate processing.

<h3 id="_domain_specification">Domain Specification</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The &lt;domain-spec&gt; string is subject to macro expansion (see Section 7).
The resulting string is the common presentation form of a fully qualified DNS
name: a series of labels separated by periods.
This domain is called the &lt;target-name&gt; in the rest of this document.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For several mechanisms, the &lt;domain-spec&gt; is optional.
If it is not provided, the &lt;domain&gt; from the check_host() arguments (see
Section 4.1) is used as the &lt;target-name&gt;.
&#34;domain&#34; and &lt;domain-spec&gt; are syntactically identical after macro expansion.
&#34;domain&#34; is an input value for check_host(), while &lt;domain-spec&gt; is computed
by check_host().</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The result of evaluating check_host() with a syntactically invalid domain is
undefined.
Examples include names with empty labels, such as &#34;foo..example.com&#34;, and
labels that are longer than 63 characters.
Some implementations choose to treat such errors as not-match and therefore
ignore such names, while others return a &#34;permerror&#34; exception.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_mechanism_definitions">Mechanism Definitions</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This section defines two types of mechanisms: basic language framework
mechanisms and designated sender mechanisms.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Basic mechanisms contribute to the language framework.
They do not specify a particular type of authorization scheme.
The basic mechanisms are as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>all
include</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Designated sender mechanisms are used to identify a set of &lt;ip&gt; addresses as
being permitted or not permitted to use the &lt;domain&gt; for sending mail.
The designated sender mechanisms are as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>a
mx
ptr (do not use)
ip4
ip6
exists</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following conventions apply to all mechanisms that perform a comparison
between &lt;ip&gt; and an IP address at any point:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If no CIDR prefix length is given in the directive, then &lt;ip&gt; and the IP
address are compared for equality.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a CIDR prefix length is specified, then only the specified number of
high-order bits of &lt;ip&gt; and the IP address are compared for equality.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When any mechanism fetches host addresses to compare with &lt;ip&gt;, when &lt;ip&gt; is
an IPv4, &#34;A&#34; records are fetched; when &lt;ip&gt; is an IPv6 address, &#34;AAAA&#34; records
are fetched.
SPF implementations on IPv6 servers need to handle both &#34;AAAA&#34; and &#34;A&#34;
records, for clients on IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses [RFC4291].
IPv4 &lt;ip&gt; addresses are only listed in an SPF record using the &#34;ip4&#34;
mechanism.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Several mechanisms rely on information fetched from the DNS.
For these DNS queries, except where noted, if the DNS server returns an error
(RCODE other than 0 or 3) or the query times out, the mechanism stops and the
topmost check_host() returns &#34;temperror&#34;.
If the server returns &#34;Name Error&#34; (RCODE 3), then evaluation of the mechanism
continues as if the server returned no error (RCODE 0) and zero answer
records.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="__all">&#34;all&#34;</h3>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>all = &#34;all&#34;</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The &#34;all&#34; mechanism is a test that always matches.
It is used as the rightmost mechanism in a record to provide an explicit
default.
For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>v=spf1 a mx -all</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Mechanisms after &#34;all&#34; will never be tested and MUST be ignored.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Any &#34;redirect&#34; modifier MUST be ignored when there is an &#34;all&#34; mechanism in
the record, regardless of the relative ordering of the terms.</p>
</div>

<p>The &#34;include&#34; mechanism triggers a recursive evaluation of <code>check_host()</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>The <code>&lt;domain-spec&gt;</code> is expanded as per <a href="#_macros">section 7</a>.</p>

<li>
<p><code>check_host()</code> is evaluated with the resulting string as the <code>&lt;domain&gt;</code>.
   The <code>&lt;ip&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;sender&gt;</code> arguments remain the same as in the current
   evaluation of <code>check_host()</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The recursive evaluation returns match, not-match, or an error.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it returns match, then the appropriate result for the &#34;include&#34;
   mechanism is used (e.g., &#34;include&#34; or &#34;&#43;include&#34; produces a &#34;pass&#34; result
   and &#34;-include&#34; produces &#34;fail&#34;).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it returns not-match or an error, the parent <code>check_host()</code> resumes
   processing as per the table below, with the previous value of <code>&lt;domain&gt;</code>
   restored.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The &#34;include&#34; mechanism makes it possible for one domain to designate
multiple administratively independent domains.
For example, a vanity domain &#34;example.net&#34; might send mail using the servers
of administratively independent domains &#34;example.com&#34; and &#34;example.org&#34;.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

<div class="content">
<pre>IN TXT &#34;v=spf1 include:example.com include:example.org -all&#34;</pre>

<p>This would direct <code>check_host()</code> to, in effect, check the records of
&#34;example.com&#34; and &#34;example.org&#34; for a &#34;pass&#34; result.
Only if the host were not permitted for either of those domains would the
result be &#34;fail&#34;.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whether this mechanism matches, does not match, or returns an exception
depends on the result of the recursive evaluation of <code>check_host()</code>:</p>

<p>The &#34;include&#34; mechanism is intended for crossing administrative boundaries.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When remaining within one administrative authority, &#34;include&#34; is usually
not the best choice.
For example, if example.com and example.org were managed by the same
entity, and if the permitted set of hosts for both domains was
&#34;mx:example.com&#34;, it would be possible for example.org to specify
&#34;include:example.com&#34;, but it would be preferable to specify
&#34;redirect=example.com&#34; or even &#34;mx:example.com&#34;.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The &#34;redirect&#34; modifier is more suitable for consolidating both authorizations
and policy into a common set to be shared within an ADMD.
Redirect is much more like a common code element to be shared among records
in a single ADMD.
It is possible to control both authorized hosts and policy for an arbitrary

   For sessions where that verb was provided more than once, the most recent
   instance is used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The &#34;r&#34; macro expands to the name of the receiving MTA.
   This SHOULD be a fully qualified domain name, but if one does not exist (as
   when the checking is done by a Mail User Agent (MUA)) or if policy
   restrictions dictate otherwise, the word &#34;unknown&#34; SHOULD be substituted.
   The domain name can be different from the name found in the MX record that
   the client MTA used to locate the receiving MTA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The &#34;t&#34; macro expands to the decimal representation of the approximate
   number of seconds since the Epoch (Midnight, January 1, 1970, UTC) at the time
   of the evaluation.
   This is the same value as the value that is returned by the
   Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) time() function in most
   standards-compliant libraries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the result of macro expansion is used in a domain name query,

<p>Uppercase macros expand exactly as their lowercase equivalents, and

   URL escaping MUST be performed for characters not in the
   &#34;unreserved&#34; set, which is defined in [RFC3986].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Care has to be taken by the sending ADMD so that macro expansion
   for legitimate email does not exceed the 63-character limit on DNS
   labels.
   The local-part of email addresses, in particular, can have
   more than 63 characters between dots.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To minimize DNS lookup resource requirements, it is better if
   sending ADMDs avoid using the &#34;s&#34;, &#34;l&#34;, &#34;o&#34;, or &#34;h&#34; macros in
   conjunction with any mechanism directive.
   Although these macros are powerful and allow per-user records to be
   published, they severely limit the ability of implementations to
   cache results of check_host() and they reduce the effectiveness of
   DNS caches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If no directive processed during the evaluation of check_host()
   contains an &#34;s&#34;, &#34;l&#34;, &#34;o&#34;, or &#34;h&#34; macro, then the results of the
   evaluation can be cached on the basis of &lt;domain&gt; and &lt;ip&gt; alone
   for as long as the DNS record involved with the shortest Time to
   Live (TTL) has not expired.</p>

Using &#34;mx&#34; over &#34;a&#34; allows the set of mail hosts to be changed easily.
Unless such changes are common, it is better to use the less
resource-intensive mechanisms like &#34;ip4&#34; and &#34;ip6&#34; over &#34;a&#34; or &#34;a&#34;

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Publishing SPF records for individual hosts is also best practice.
The host name is generally the identity used in the 5321.HELO/.EHLO

In the case of messages with a null 5321.MailFrom, this is used as the
domain for 5321.MailFrom SPF checks, in addition to being used in
5321.HELO/.EHLO-based SPF checks.
The standard SPF record for an individual host that is involved in
mail processing is:</p>

Examples include mailing lists (see Section 5.3 of [RFC5598]) and
ReSenders (Section 5.2 of [RFC5598]).
This is discussed in [RFC5321], Section 3.9.
For the operation of SPF, the essential concern is the email address

   number of DNS lookups, malicious domains could publish records
   that exceed these limits in an attempt to waste computation effort
   at their targets when they send them mail.
   Malicious domains could also design SPF records that cause
   particular implementations to use excessive memory or CPU or to
   trigger bugs.
   If a receiver is configured to accept mail with an SPF result of
   &#34;temperror&#34;, such an attack might result in mail that would
   otherwise have been rejected due to an SPF &#34;fail&#34; result being
   accepted.
   This potential attack is based on specially crafted SPF records
   being used to exhaust DNS resources of the victim.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Malicious parties could send a large volume of mail purporting to
   come from the intended target to a wide variety of legitimate mail
   hosts.
   These legitimate machines would then present a DNS load on the
   target as they fetched the relevant records.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Malicious parties could, in theory, use SPF records as a vehicle
   for DNS lookup amplification for a DoS attack.
   In this scenario, the attacker publishes an SPF record in its own
   DNS that uses &#34;a&#34; and &#34;mx&#34; mechanisms directed toward the intended
   victim, e.g., &#34;a:example.com a:foo.example.com a:bar.example.com
   &#8230;&#8203;&#34; and then distributes mail with a MAIL FROM value including its
   own domain in large volume to a wide variety of destinations.
   Any such destination operating an SPF verifier will begin querying
   all of the names associated with the &#34;a&#34; mechanisms in that record.
   The names used in the record needn&#39;t exist for the attack to be
   effective.
   Operational experience since the publication of [RFC4408] suggests
   that mitigation of this class of attack can be accomplished with
   minimal impact on the deployed base by having the verifier abort
   processing and return &#34;permerror&#34; (Section 2.6.7) as soon as more
   than two &#34;void lookups&#34; have been encountered (defined in Section
   4.6.4).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Of these, the case of a third party referenced in the SPF record is
the easiest for a DoS attack to effectively exploit.
As a result, limits that might seem reasonable for an individual mail
server can still allow an unreasonable amount of bandwidth
amplification.
Therefore, the processing limits need to be quite low.</p>

<h3 id="_spf_authorized_email_may_contain_other_false_identities">SPF-Authorized Email May Contain Other False Identities</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The &#34;MAIL FROM&#34; and &#34;HELO&#34; identity authorizations do not provide
assurance about the authorization/authenticity of other identities
used in the message.
It is entirely possible for a malicious sender to inject a message
using his own domain in the identities used by SPF and have that
domain&#39;s SPF record authorize the sending host, and yet the message
can easily list other identities in its header.
Unless the user or the MUA takes care to note that the authorized
identity does not match the other more commonly presented identities
(such as the From: header field), the user might be lulled into a
false sense of security.</p>

<h3 id="_spoofed_dns_and_ip_data">Spoofed DNS and IP Data</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are two aspects of this protocol that malicious parties could
exploit to undermine the validity of the check_host() function:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The evaluation of check_host() relies heavily on DNS.
   A malicious attacker could attack the DNS infrastructure and cause
   check_host() to see spoofed DNS data, and then return incorrect
   results.
   This could include returning &#34;pass&#34; for an &lt;ip&gt; value where the
   actual domain&#39;s record would evaluate to &#34;fail&#34;.
   See [RFC3833] for a description of DNS weaknesses, and see
   [RFC4033] for a countermeasure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The client IP address, &lt;ip&gt;, is assumed to be correct.
   In a modern, correctly configured system, the risk of this not
   being true is nil.</p>

<h3 id="_cross_user_forgery">Cross-User Forgery</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By definition, SPF policies just map domain names to sets of
authorized MTAs, not whole email addresses to sets of authorized
users.
Although the &#34;l&#34; macro (Section 7) provides a limited way to define
individual sets of authorized MTAs for specific email addresses, it is
generally impossible to verify, through SPF, the use of specific email
addresses by individual users of the same MTA.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is up to mail services and their MTAs to directly prevent
cross-user forgery: based on SMTP AUTH ([RFC4954]), users have to be
restricted to using only those email addresses that are actually under
their control (see Section 6.1 of [RFC6409]).
Another means to verify the identity of individual users is message
cryptography, such as Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) ([RFC4880]) or S/MIME
([RFC5751]).</p>

<h3 id="_untrusted_information_sources">Untrusted Information Sources</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An SPF-compliant receiver gathers information from the SMTP commands
it receives and from the published DNS records of the sending domain
holder (e.g., &#34;HELO&#34; domain name, the &#34;MAIL FROM&#34; address from the
envelope, and SPF DNS records published by the domain holder).
These parameters are not validated in the SMTP process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All of these pieces of information are generated by actors outside of
the authority of the receiver, and thus are not guaranteed to be
accurate or legitimate.</p>

<h4 id="_recorded_results">Recorded Results</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This information, passed to the receiver in the Received-SPF: or
Authentication-Results: trace fields, can be returned to the client
MTA as an SMTP rejection message.
If such an SMTP rejection message is generated, the information from
the trace fields has to be checked for such problems as invalid
characters and excessively long lines.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_external_explanations">External Explanations</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the authorization check fails, an explanation string could be
included in the reject response.
Both the sender and the rejecting receiver need to be aware that the
explanation was determined by the publisher of the SPF record checked
and, in general, not the receiver.
The explanation can contain malicious URLs, or it might be offensive
or misleading.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Explanations returned to sender domains due to &#34;exp&#34; modifiers
(Section 6.2) were generated by the sender policy published by the
domain holders themselves.
As long as messages are only returned with non-delivery notifications
([RFC3464]) to domains publishing the explanation strings from their
own DNS SPF records, the only affected parties are the original
publishers of the domain&#39;s SPF records.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In practice, such non-delivery notifications can be misdirected, such
as when an MTA accepts an email and only later generates the
notification to a forged address, or when an email forwarder does not
direct the bounce back to the original sender.</p>

<h4 id="_macro_expansion">Macro Expansion</h4>

<p>Macros (Section 7) allow senders to inject arbitrary text (any

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_privacy_exposure">Privacy Exposure</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Checking SPF records causes DNS queries to be sent to the domain
owner.
These DNS queries, especially if they are caused by the &#34;exists&#34;
mechanism, can contain information about who is sending email and
likely to which MTA the email is being sent.
This can introduce some privacy concerns, which are more or less of an
issue depending on local laws and the relationship between the ADMD
and the person sending the email.</p>

<h3 id="_delivering_mail_producing_a_fail_result">Delivering Mail Producing a &#34;Fail&#34; Result</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Operators that choose to deliver mail for which SPF produces a &#34;fail&#34;
result need to understand that they are admitting content that is
explicitly not authorized by the purported sender.
While there are known failure modes that can be considered &#34;false
negatives&#34;, the distinct choice to admit those messages increases
end-user exposure to likely harm.
This is especially true for domains belonging to known good actors
that are typically well-behaved; unauthorized mail from those sources
might well be subjected to much higher skepticism and content
analysis.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>SPF does not, however, include the capacity to distinguish good actors
from bad ones, nor does it handle the concept of known actors versus
unknown ones.
Those notions are out of scope for this specification.</p>
