=  CHANGELOG
:toc:

This library is released each month, usually at the first week of month.

==  share v0.18.0 (2020-08-xx)

===  Breaking changes

* big: add global flag MarshalJSONAsString

MarshalJSONAsString define the default return behaviour of MarshalJSON().
If its true (the default) the returned JSON format will encapsulated in
double quote, as string instead of as numeric.

* http: do not return error based on response code

The error in doRequest should be about connection error, everything
else should be handled by user.


==  share v0.17.0 (2020-07-05)

===  Breaking changes

*  dns: replace RDataText with plain []byte

*  http: add parameter headers to client methods

*  http: return the http.Response as the first parameter

===  Bug fixes

==  share v0.16.0 (2020-06-05)

===  Breaking changes

*  dns: refactoring loading hosts and master files

   Instead of as methods in Server, we detach the LoadHostDir and
   LostMasterDir into functions that return list of filename and their
   content.

*  dns: disable serving DoH and DoT if port is not set (0)

   Previously, if HTTPPort or TLSPort is not set (0) we set it to default
   value and keep serving the DNS over HTTP and TLS.  Sometimes, user may
   want to serve DNS over UDP only.

   This changes disable serving DNS over HTTP (DoH) and TLS (DoT) if port
   is not set, or 0.

*  email: rename ParseAddress function to ParseMailboxes

*  http: add parameter "insecure" when creating new client

*  ini: fix inconsistencies between empty string and boolean true

   In Git specification, an empty variable is equal to boolean true.
   This cause inconsistency between empty string and boolean true.

*  memfs: simplify the API, add directory parameter to New

   This changes add parameter directory to be mounted in New(), so user
   did not need to call Mount manually

   This cause the Mount method and its sibling, Unmount and IsMounted
   become unneeded, so we remove them.

===  Bug fixes

*  api/telegram/bot: fix  request parameter on GetMyCommands

*  os/exec: new package to simplify the standard "os/exec"

   New extension to standard package is function ParseCommandArgs() that
   receive input as string and return itas command and list of arguments.
   Unlike strings.Fields() which only separated the field by space,
   ParseCommandArgs can detect possible single, double, or back quotes.

   Another extension is Run() function that accept the string command
   to be executed and their standard output and error.

*  sql: add method to migrate database schema

   The Migrate method migrate the database using list of SQL files inside
   a directory.
   Each SQL file in directory will be executed in alphabetical order based on
   the last state.
   
   The state of migration will be saved in table "_migration" with the SQL
   file name that has been executed and the timestamp.

===  Enhancements

*  api/telegram/bot: delete webhook upon setting new webhook

*  dns: do not load hidden hosts and master file

   Previously, the LoadHostDir and LoadMasterDir load all files inside
   the directory without checking if its hidden (starting with dot) or not.
   
   This changes make the hidden file not loaded so one can disable it
   temporarily by prefixing it with dot.

*  ini: make the add method append the variable after existing same key

*  memfs: make the Node Readdir works when calling from generated Go code

   Previously, the Go generated code from call to GoGenerate() set only
   mapping of path to node.  Calling Readdir() using http.File using

     root, err := mfs.Open("/")
     fis, err := root.Readdir(0)

   will return nil on fis.

   This changes add all child nodes to generated node.

* api/telegram/bot: Go package for Telegram API Bot
* http: implement a simplified HTTP client
* net/html: new package to simplify the golang.org/x/net/html

  The x/net/html package currently only provide bare raw functionalities
  to iterate tree, there is no check for empty node, no function to
  get attribute by name, and no simple way to iterate tree without looping it
  manually.

  This package extends the package by adding methods to get node's attribute
  by name, get the first non-empty child, get the next non-empty sibling, and
  to iterate each node in the tree from top to bottom.

===  Enhancements

*  big: return "0" instead of "<nil>" on Rat.String()
*  big: return false if Rat is nil on IsGreaterThanZero
*  http: add parameter to set default client's headers

   require calling different call for registration.  This change simplify
   it to one call only, "RegisterEndpoint", and the registration process
   will be handled automatically based on value on field Method.

*  mining/math: move the package from "lib/mining/" to "lib/" directory

===  New features

*  debug: add a wrapper for starting and stopping CPU profile

implement key binding using colon ":" on path.  For example, registering
path "/:x/y" will bind key "x" to a string value that can be accessed on
http.Request.Form using Get method.

===  Breaking Changes

*  ini: set variable with "=" without a value default to empty string

Previously, a variable end with "=" will have value set to "true".
For example,

----
[section]
var =
----

set the "var" value to string "true".

==  share v0.8.2 (2019-09-05)

===  Enhancements

*  http: make the request body always available even after ParseForm()
+
Previously, if the request type is query, form, or JSON, we call the
ParseForm() to let the http.Request read the Body POST form data and fill
the Form and/or PostForm fields.  This  method will cause the request
Body will become empty since its already read and closed.
One of use case of POST with form data is to check the integrity of POST
body using checksum, which is not possible using only ParseForm().
This commit read all the body first into reqBody and recreate the request
Body back using ioutil.NopCloser and bytes.Buffer.

*  all: replace document generator from asciidoctor to ciigo
+
Previously, generating HTML files from asciidoc files require installing
ruby, asciidoctor, and its dependency through Gemfile.
To simplify this, we replace it with ciigo.  Ciigo not only can convert
the asciidoc files but it also support serving the file inside HTTP
server and watching changes on asciidoc files during development for
local previewing.

*  memfs: log and ignore error from NewNode
+
An error for calling NewNode should not stop processing all files
in directory.

*  io: log and ignore error from NewNode
+
An error for calling NewNode should not stop processing all files
in directory.


==  share v0.8.1 (2019-08-05)

===  Enhancements

*  lib/ini: add functions to marshal/unmarshal bytes from/to struct.
+
The format to marshal/unmarshal ini stream is behave like JSON.

*  lib/memfs: add method to encode the content of file.
+
The ContentEncode() method encode each node's content into specific
encoding, in other words this method can be used to compress the content
of file in memory before being served or written.
Only file with size greater than 0 will be encoded.
List of known encoding is "gzip".

*  lib/memfs: ignore generated output filename on GoGenerate
+
In case the user Mount() the directory that include the generated output
file, we want that file to be excluded from .go static source.

*  lib/memfs: set the Node Size to be zero if node is directory
